	I just added some information to the shared google doc term bank. I need to add a link to my person card. Hopefully things will start coming together. I've been lagging a bit behind on sleep: need to put that as #1 for a bit to restore my brain functionality. I attended the group lab that Wednesday and was just playing around with some image ideas on my home page. I should add an About Me page soon and maybe add my jokes codesketch to my projects page. However, it isn't complete yet. Anyways, I'm excited about the direction this is going in.

	Making my website was kind of fun. I spent some time picking which fonts I liked: I prefer the handwriting types: it's just more soothing to me. I worked on copying some of the css that was in my home page over to my journal and projects to keep the same menu bar on top for all of them. I worked on the css for the paragraph and header tags and the overall background color for the website as well. I also added a link tag that allows a user to go back to the home page from the journal and projects pages. I haven't added an about page yet, so when someone clicks on that, it will just go to the projects page. <br> <br>

	Something that was a bit frustrating was making sure the menu bar at the top (using the table) would be evenly assumed. I assumed all the cells would have the same width, but it turns out that 'About Me' because it is longer takes up more space and that cell is larger by default. To get rid of that, I had to play with the table layout and make sure that each cell took up 1/3 of the width. I also had some trouble spacing out the header and paragraph tags. I wanted the journal text to be directly under the heading without any spacing, but I'm not totally sure how to do that yet. I saw that the h1 tag had the least spacing, so I went with that, but I want to be able to do this more on my own. I also added a bunch of br tags to create line spaces throughout the journal. Excited! Happy November!

	So far, I have worked on my person-card and my code sketch by adding various circles to my pages, adding event listeners, and experimenting with CSS for background images. I have also had a few labs with you discussing Javascript though it is still a bit confusing to me. For my person-card, I have been experimenting with adding different colors, centering, and noticing the stop-start pattern of the gifs. <br><br>

	I have learnt about how html, css, and javascript work together in a document to create an overall effect. I’ve learnt how divs work, how divs can be put together inside of each other, and how classes work and how they pair with id’s. I’ve also learnt about background colors and images using css and how hover effects can be created using css, but if you want to use event listeners in the console, you have to use javascript. I’ve learnt how to use the console to proofread our code and how to check that we have both opening and closing tags. I’ve learnt how css might use curly brackets and html uses carrots. <br><br>

	Some things have been frustrating is making sure to keep organized when you have multiple divs and dealing with a lot of items in the page and how to program them individually and together. The idea of positioning relatively vs. absolutely is still a relatively new concept for me and one that I will continue thinking about and working on. I’m still a bit unsure of how to console log when the mouse clicks in a certain area and get only the x and y coordinates, but I think I just need more practice with javascript in general. <br><br>

	I had two labs one week, I haven’t had one since but I plan to do some more in that Wednesday morning block as that time usually works well for both me and Sofia, and I really like working with her. The labs are really helpful as I learn more about the things more pertaining today, and I get to refresh the concepts we learn in class before I can take them and work on the more on my own. <br><br>

	I would love to learn more about how javascript allows for lots of different choices similar to a tree diagram. Basically how one choice can lead to one result and another choice can lead to a different result. I would love to learn more how the console.log function can assist or work in tandem with what you are trying to achieve on the screen. I would love to learn how images that you create by hand or on laptop can be used on a webpage. I would love to learn how to create my own functions and then use them or build more upon them later. <br><br>

	I’ve been tending to leaving some of the assignments until the last minute, and I want to lay it out more and say, hey we’re going to work on this for 40-45 minutes today, or, today we’re going to watch some videos for 20 minutes rather than an-hour straight block or cramming everything in because then my work won’t be as good as it can be, and it won’t be as creative, and I kinda like creativity, so I want more of a chance to show that. I also think I can do more research (Google, W3 school) on my own of things I don’t know before going straight to you or to the class.
